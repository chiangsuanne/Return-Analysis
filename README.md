# Return-Analysis

## Business Task
What is causing the high number of returned orders at the Superstore?  
In this project, we will be preparing an analysis for the CEO of the Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.  

## Data Set
- Superstore (https://github.com/chiangsuanne/Return-Analysis/blob/main/Superstore.xls)

## Tools
Tableau for joining and cleaning data for analysis and visualization

## Analysis
1. How should returns be measured? Is the return rate, the total cost of returns or the total number of returns a better measure? When is one better than the other?
2. What are the key root causes of returns?

## Conclusion
In Conclusion, this superstore has a high return rate that is eroding profits.  

The composite chart showing the correlation between the Total Order vs. Return Rate should be analyzed to determine which Category and Sub-Category to focus in terms of marketing and sales.  
This composite chart showing both the absolute (total number of orders ) and return rate helps us to see which category/sub-category have the highest return rates and whether they're the categories that were sold/returned the most.  
It is not feasible to judge the categories based on the absolute values of returned items.  
For example, if you look at the Binders sub-category, you'll see that it has the most returns in terms of orders.  
However, it doesn't mean that it's the worst in terms of return rate as it is actually around average.  

It is recommended to take into consideration the percentage of return rate so that decisions of removing certain categories are not made based on absolute values only because it had a higher return number.
