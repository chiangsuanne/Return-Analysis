# Case Study of Returned Items
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze and address the issue of high return rates by identifying the root causes of returns and developing a Tableau dashboard for monitoring.  

### Company Overview
The Superstore is a leading retail company that offers a wide range of products to customers. With a significant online presence, the Superstore has been facing challenges related to a high number of returned orders, impacting customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Project Overview
The project aims to analyze and address the issue of high return rates at the Superstore. By conducting a comprehensive analysis, I identified the root causes of returns and developed a Tableau dashboard to present actionable insights to the CEO for informed decision-making.

## Data Set
- Superstore (https://github.com/chiangsuanne/Return-Analysis/blob/main/Superstore.xls)

## Tools
Tableau for joining and cleaning data for analysis and visualization

## Project Analysis
**Conducting In-depth Analysis of Returns**
In addressing the challenge of high return rates at the Superstore, I systematically analyzed various aspects of returns. I created worksheets with diverse perspectives, including:
* A scatterplot correlating total sales and returns by product subcategory.  
* A bar chart depicting return rates by product category.  
* Evaluation of return rates by customer, filtering out those with only one order.  
* Mapping return rates geographically to identify any concentration patterns.  
* Analyzing return rates over time to uncover potential seasonal effects.  
* Crafting composite charts integrating multiple factors such as date, geography, and product category.
  
The analysis revealed crucial insights into the factors contributing to returns, facilitating a data-driven understanding of the problem.    

**Building an Informative Dashboard for Monitoring Returns**
In the second phase, I translated our findings into a Tableau dashboard designed for effective monitoring. This involved:
* Creating a low-fidelity mock-up of the dashboard with three variations.  
* Developing a pen-and-paper sketch for visualization and design purposes.  
* Constructing a template with empty containers to match the chosen mock-up.  
* Incorporating relevant markers, images, and titles into the finalized dashboard.  
* Adding worksheets to the dashboard template to provide a holistic view of return insights.

The result is a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard that facilitates quick identification of key metrics and trends related to returns.  

**Presenting Insights and Dashboard Functionality**
To effectively communicate our analysis and dashboard functionality, I constructed a compelling story arc for presentation. This included:
* A summary of return analysis, highlighting key findings and insights.  
* Clarification on different metrics for measuring returns and when each is most relevant.  
* Identification of key root causes contributing to the high return rates.  
* Detailed overviews of each component of the Tableau dashboard, explaining their significance.  
* A demonstration of how the dashboard should be used, emphasizing filter utilization for root cause identification.  
* Providing actionable steps and recommendations based on insights from the dashboard.  
* Concluding the presentation with proposed next steps, including the implementation of the dashboard for ongoing monitoring and decision-making.
  
The project not only addressed the challenge of high return rates but also equipped the Superstore with a powerful tool for continuous improvement and strategic decision-making.

## Executive Summary
### Conclusion
In Conclusion, this Superstore is grappling with a substantial return rate that poses a significant threat to profitability.  

In addition to the insights gleaned from the composite chart showing the correlation between Total Order and Return Rate, another crucial conclusion can be drawn. The bar chart illustrating return rates by product category reinforces the need to focus marketing and sales efforts strategically. By combining insights from both charts, we can pinpoint categories and subcategories that not only generate high sales but also exhibit concerning return rates.  

It is evident that judging categories based solely on the absolute number of returned items can be misleading. For instance, the Binders sub-category appears to have the highest return count in terms of orders, but when considering the return rate, it is actually around average. This highlights the importance of evaluating categories based on the percentage of return rate, ensuring a more accurate assessment of their performance.  

The recommendation is to prioritize the percentage of return rate as a key metric in decision-making. Relying solely on absolute values may lead to misguided actions, such as removing certain categories based on higher return numbers. By emphasizing the return rate percentage, the Superstore can make more informed decisions about product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction initiatives to effectively mitigate the impact of returns on profitability.  
### Suggestions for Further Improvement or Business Outcomes
1. **Refine Marketing Strategies:** Tailor marketing efforts to emphasize categories and subcategories with both high sales and low return rates. By understanding the correlation between Total Order and Return Rate, the Superstore can focus on promoting products that not only attract customers but also have a lower likelihood of being returned.  
2. **Optimize Product Mix:** Analyze the return rates by product category to optimize the Superstore's product mix. Consider reevaluating the inventory of items within categories with disproportionately high return rates, exploring alternatives or making adjustments to meet customer expectations more effectively.  
3. **Customer Segmentation:** Leverage insights from the return rate by customer analysis to segment customers based on their likelihood to return orders. Implement targeted strategies for customer retention and satisfaction, such as personalized promotions, improved customer support, or loyalty programs.  
4. **Geographic Considerations:** Utilize the geographic insights from the return rate by location analysis to tailor strategies for specific regions. This may involve adjusting marketing approaches, inventory levels, or customer service initiatives to address location-specific challenges and preferences.  
5. **Time-Sensitive Actions:** Consider implementing time-sensitive actions based on the analysis of return rates over time. For example, if there are seasonal patterns in returns, the Superstore can adjust inventory levels, marketing strategies, and customer engagement efforts to align with these patterns.  
6. **Dashboard Integration:** Ensure that the Tableau dashboard becomes an integral part of the decision-making process. Regularly update and monitor the dashboard, incorporating new data to track the effectiveness of implemented strategies and identify emerging trends or issues related to returns.  
7. **Educate Stakeholders:** Educate internal stakeholders, including marketing teams, sales teams, and customer service representatives, about the importance of considering return rates as a key metric. Promote a culture of data-driven decision-making to enhance the overall understanding of the impact of returns on profitability.  
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a framework for continuous improvement based on feedback from the dashboard and ongoing analysis. Encourage cross-functional collaboration to address challenges related to returns and implement iterative changes to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce return rates over time.  

By implementing these suggestions, the Superstore can not only mitigate the impact of high return rates but also foster a more resilient and customer-centric business model, ultimately leading to improved profitability and customer satisfaction.
